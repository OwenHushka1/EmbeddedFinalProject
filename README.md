# EmbeddedProject6
This is an embedded C project intended to be used on the STM32F429ZITx FPGA board. It is a reflex tester. The game begins by displaying the instructions and waiting for the user to follow the directions and press the button to begin. After the button is pressed, it will wait a random amount of time and will randomly display either a circle or a square. Eventually it will display a square and the user will press the button as soon as the square appears. Next, the instructions for the second game will be displayed and the user again presses the button when they are ready to begin the game. In this game, there is a 2x2 grid and after random amounts of time circles are drawn in random squares for random amounts of time. When a circle appears in the bottom left square, the user should press the button. The third game consists of a ball moving across a line which is in the middle of the screen. The ball starts on the line and moves back and forth across the line and the user should press the button as soon as the ball crosses the line for three times. After this game, the results of the game are displayed in milliseconds.
